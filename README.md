Mokesell is a new online shopping platform that makes it fun, simple and enjoyable for users to shop online. 
## Design Process

## Features
Planned features: 
- **Ecommerce platform**
	- Loyalty program: 
	- We will have a loyalty program that rewards users based on their total spending. The current rate for the loyalty rewards system is every dollar spent awards 2 cents of Mokesell credit.
- **User account management**
	- Account management
	-  Simple username and password is all the user will need to create an account. 	    
	- To become a seller, identification must be provided to serve as a precaution against scamming
	- If scams do occur, users can make reports to our customer service, and the case will be handed over to relevant authorities if crime is suspected.
- **Listing management**
	- Listing Bumps: 
		- Sellers can purchase listing bumps to have their listings appear first in search results that are relevant.
		- This benefits both the seller and the company as the company earns money from bump purchases, and sellers have a wider reach to potential customers.
		- There will be different plans that offer varying bump durations, and VIP bumps that show up even in non-relevant searches. 
		- Bumped listings would have a special label to let users know it was bumped. 
	- Listing Ranking: 
		- Listings will be taken down after 30 days of inactivity, i.e no sales. 
	- Listing Properties: 
		- Sellers will have the option of placing specific properties for item listings such as “Condition”, “Price Negotiable”, “Meet-up only”.
- **Search and browsing**
	- Search filters
		- Customers will be able to filter by categories such as those mentioned in Listing Management. There will also be a search bar for users who want to find specific products. 
	- Search history
		- Customers will be able to come back to previously viewed listings by placing the product in their wishlist.
- **Communication and Transaction**
	- Chat feature: 
		- Buyers would be able to start chats with sellers to discuss transaction details for items they are interested in buying. 
	- Offer submission: 
	    - Buyers can submit an offer price through the system for an item they are interested in. 
	- Bidding system: 
		- Sellers can choose to put high-demand items up for auction for buyers to bid on
		    
		- Sellers can set a starting bid price and the maximum time duration for which the bid would last for. 
	- Review system: 
		- Both buyer and seller can rate and post reviews about each other once a transaction has been successfully completed. 
		- Ratings are done using the 5 star system, where a user can input their satisfaction of a transaction done with another user out of 5 stars. 
		- Reviews are conducted optionally where users can write about their experience doing a transaction with another user, which would appear in the reviewed user’s account. 
- **Additional features:** 
	- Notifications
		- Notification for price drops of items in wishlist and chat messages
	- Delivery
		- Buyers can meet up with seller to collect bought items in-person. 
		- Buyers can also choose to opt for Delivery via Singpost delivery.
